## Commands
This pack provides the following commands: `CommentIssue`, `IssueInfo`, `CreateIssue`, `IssueAssign`, `IssueCreateLink`, `IssueGetLink`, `IssueDeleteLink`
### issueInfo command
This command returns information about a specific issue.
#### Input
This command's input is the id of the desired issue. The issue can either be a URL with an issueId base or an issueId in string representation.
E.g
```
"input": "TEST-123",
"input": "http://foo.bar/TEST-123"
```

Because slack automatically places embeded URLs in between `< >` tags, then the following is also accepted:
`"input": "<http://foo.bar/TEST-123>"`

[issue-assign]: https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/7.6.1/#api/2/issue-assign
### IssueAssign command
Assign a user to a JIRA issue

### Input
The input is a `json` object with a `username` and an `issueId` fields. According to the Jira [API docs][issue-assign], the username field can be left empty to unassign the issue, which is why it can be omitted from the input. Likewise, a "-1" string name will `auto-assign` the issue.
`input JSON object`:
```json
{
  "username": "test-123", // optional, nil name == unassign
  "issueId": "ISSUE-01" // required
}
```
#### Output
The output consists of two events: an `AssignEvent` or an `AssignFailureEvent`

#### AssignEvent
If the assignment is successful, an event will be propagated back with a payload consisting of the initial request paramters.
```json
"payload": {
  "username":"test-123",
  "issueId": "ISSUE-01"
}
```

#### AssignFailureEvent
If the assignment is unsuccessful, an `assignFailureEvent` will come back with a payload consisting of the initial request and the error message.
```json
"payload": {
  "username": "foo",
  "issueId": "ISSUE01",
  "error": "Unauthorised"
}
```

### Links

Jira offers the possibility to manage links between issues. The commands that are available to do so are `IssueGetLink`, `IssueDeleteLink` and `IssueCreateLink`. While their functionality is self-explanatory, the input/output varies depending on the operation.

The two event types in the case of links are:
1. `Link` --> propagated on success
2. `LinkFailure` --> propagated on failure

#### IssueGetLink

will return a link object that links two issues. 

#### Input:
The input is a `json` object with a `linkId` field, where the `linkId` is id of the respective link object. Generally, those ids can be obtained by looking at a card information (`IssueInfo` now supports link information!).
```json
{
 "linkId": "12351245"
}
```

#### Output:
In case of a success, the output will contain the link information:
```json
{
 "inwardIssue": "<issue-key>",
 "outwardIssue": "<issue-key>",
 "linkType": {
   "Name": "Depends"
  },
 "Comment": "Link related issues!" 
}
```

#### IssueCreateLink
Based on 2 project keys and and a link type, create a link with that type between the 2 issues.

#### Input:
```json
{
 "inwardIssue": "<issue-key>",
  "outwardIssue": "<issue-key>",
  "linkType": "<type>",
}
```

#### Output:
The output is the initial request or a failure event if unsuccessful.

#### IssueDeleteLink
Based on a `linkId`, the link between 2 issues is deleted.

#### Input:
```json
{
 "linkId": "12341234"
}
```

#### Output:
The initial request if successful or a failure event if unsuccessful.
